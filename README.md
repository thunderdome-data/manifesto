#The DFM Data Team Manifesto

As journalists and developers, we believe strong data reporting leads to engaging news applications and empowers our local newsrooms to produce coverage that users want and need. 

This belief informs the things we value:

- deep, contextual analysis and presentation of data.
- applications with broad regional or national appeal.
- reusable tools and frameworks.
- providing our users the best experience and interaction possible.
- working in close cooperation with journalists around the company and within Thunderdome and training them to bring data analysis techniques into their own daily reporting.
- openness and transparency, in the subjects we cover and in our reporting and development. To this end, we document our processes, show the work behind our work publicly and share our data and tools with the open source, reader and journalism communities whenever we can. 

In a rapidly changing industry, our mission may evolve over time, but our core values will remain at the heart of our work.
